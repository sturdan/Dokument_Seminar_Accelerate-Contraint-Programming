Danke dem Adlerauge, welches dies bemerkt hat! Für diejenigen, die mehr lernen möchten, empfehle ich das Buch von Michael Nielsen, der in Neuronale Netzwerke und Deep Learning einführt: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy Zwei Sachen sind in diesem Buch besonders toll. Erstens, es ist gratis verfügbar, also tu's mir gleich und mach eine kleine Spende an Nielsen, falls es Dir etwas bringt. Da Zweite ist, dass es um Code-Beispiele und Daten gebaut ist, die Du selbst herunterladen kannst, und welche die gleichen Beispiele aufzeigt, wie in diesem Video. Super für aktives Lernen! https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-ne... Auch zu empfehlen: Chris Olah's Blog: http://colah.github.io/ Schau Dir Welch Labs an, für mehr Videos zum Thema Machine Learning. ~~~•~Learning~To~See~[...~~ ~~~•~Neural~Networks~D...~~ Für diejenigen unter Euch, die noch tiefer gehen möchten, wäre der Text "Deep Learning" von Goodfellow, Bengio und Courville geeignet.

  abstract = {Although frequent reference is made to acoustic radiation pressure in treatises and memoirs on sound, there appears to be no systematic theoretical development of the subject enabling actual pressures on obstacles of simple geometrical form to be calculated. In the audible range of acoustic frequencies, it is possible to devise, in a number of ways, means of measuring pressure amplitudes in sound waves as first order effects. At supersonic frequencies, however, these methods are no longer serviceable. When the dimensions of resonators of diaphragms become comparable with the wave-length, the physical effects which enable the pressure amplitude to be measured involve intractable diffraction problems, while the extremely high frequencies and small amplitudes involved make the employment of stroboscopic methods of observation extremely difficult. It has been shown, however, that at supersonic frequencies the acoustic radiation pressures on spheres and discs become sufficiently large to be measured easily, at any rate, in liquids. The mean pressure is generally assumed to be proportional to the energy density in the neighbourhood of the obstacle, and on this basis relative measurements can be made, for instance, in the radiation field of a supersonic oscillator. Such formulæ may be obtained without restriction as to wave-length, for spheres in plane progressive and stationary radiation fields, and the magnitude of the pressure is found to be of entirely different orders of magnitude in the two cases.},

  abstract = {We present a simple dynamic model for predicting the manipulation behavior of an acoustically levitated sphere. The model allows calculating the sphere position over time and is demonstrated for two manipulation strategies: a straight motion with a constant manipulation velocity and a straight motion in which the sphere acceleration follows a cosine function. The dynamic model as well as the manipulation strategies are verified experimentally in an acoustic levitator system consisting of an array of 16 by 16 ultrasonic transducers emitting at 40 kHz and an opposing reflector. In this system, a glass sphere of 2 mm in diameter is manipulated horizontally by controlling the phases of the transducers. The sphere motion is recorded by a high-speed camera and a tracking algorithm is used for capturing the sphere position over time. Moreover, a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is applied on a path-following problem to translate the sphere along a given reference trajectory by means of a model-based optimal feedforward control. The proposed dynamic model as well as the methodology presented in this paper enable faster manipulation speeds with reduced oscillations during the object translation.},

  abstract = {Der Luenberger-Beobachter wird dazu verwendet, nicht messbare oder zu aufw¨andig messbare Systemzust¨ande zu rekonstruieren, d.h. zu beobachten, in dem ein Streckenmodell parallel zur Strecke geschaltet wird. Damit St¨orungen abklingen, wird die Differenz des Messausgangs u¨ber eine Ru¨ckfu¨hrverst¨arkung zuru¨ckgefu¨hrt. Beim Luenberger-Beobachter wird sie durch eine Dynamik-Vorgabe z.B. u¨ber eine Polplatzierung bestimmt. Je h¨oher die Dynamik gew¨ahlt wird, desto schneller klingen zwar impulsf¨ormige St¨orungen ab und desto kleiner ist der station¨are Fehler bei sprungf¨ormigen St¨orungen, aber desto mehr wird auch das Messrauschen verst¨arkt. Damit sprungf¨ormige St¨orungen zu keinem station¨aren Fehler des Zustandsvektors fu¨hren, muss ein St¨orgr¨oßenbeobachter verwendet werden. Der station¨are Kalman-Filter ist in seiner Struktur identisch mit dem Luenberger-Beobachter, aber der Ru¨ckfu¨hrvektor, d.h. die Kalman-Verst¨arkung, wird nur unter Beru¨cksichtigung der Eigenschaften des Systemund Messrauschens derart entworfen, dass das Rauschen der beobachteten, d.h. gesch¨atzten, Zust¨ande minimal wird. Eine Dynamikanforderung geht hierbei nicht mit in den Entwurf ein. Der Extended Kalman-Filter ist die Erweiterung auf nichtlineare Systeme, wobei bei der Berechnung der Kalman-Verst¨arkung anstelle der System-Matrizen die entsprechenden zeitvarianten Jacobi-Matrizen ¨ahnlich einer Linearisierung verwendet werden, wodurch sich auch eine zeitvariante Kalman-Verst¨arkung ergibt. Nach den theoretischen Herleitungen und Vergleichen wurden Luenberger-Beobachter und Kalman-Filter schließlich fu¨r ein klassisches Testmodell aus der Mechatronik, der Gleichstromnebenschlussmaschine, entworfen und mit Hilfe von MATLAB/Simulink simuliert. Da Lastmomente konstante St¨orungen sind, die ohne Behandlung zu station¨aren Fehlern fu¨hren, war es sehr viel vorteilhafter, ein St¨orgr¨oßenmodell einzubeziehen und daher einen St¨orgr¨oßen-Luenberger-Beobachter bzw. St¨orgr¨oßen-Kalman-Filter zu verwenden. Bei den fiktiven aber realit¨atsnahen Modellparametern hatte das Kalman-Filter so ein schlechtes dynamisches Verhalten, dass es vorteilhafter war, ein einfaches PT1-Filter mit relativ kleiner Zeitkonstante zur Gl¨attung der beobachteten Zust¨ande des Luenberger-Beobachters zu verwenden.},

The proposed algorithm is a combination of funnel MPC, i.e., MPC with a particular stage cost, and the model-free adaptive funnel controller. The new robust funnel MPC scheme guarantees output tracking of reference signals within prescribed performance bounds -- even in the presence of unknown disturbances and a structural model-plant mismatch. We show initial and recursive feasibility of the proposed control scheme without imposing terminal conditions or any requirements on the prediction horizon. Moreover, we allow for model updates at runtime. To this end, we propose a proper initialization strategy, which ensures that recursive feasibility is preserved. Finally, we validate the performance of the proposed robust MPC scheme by simulations.},

  abstract = {The methodology of funnel control was introduced in the early 2000s, and it has developed since then in many respects achieving a level of mathematical maturity balanced by practical applications. Its fundamental tenet is the attainment of prescribed transient and asymptotic behaviour for continuous-time controlled dynamical processes encompassing linear and nonlinear systems described by functional differential equations, differential-algebraic systems, and partial differential equations. Considered are classes of systems specified by structural properties - such as relative degree and stable internal dynamics - of the systems only, the precise systems' data are in general unknown; the latter reflects the property that in general any model of a dynamical process is not precise. Prespecified are: a funnel shaped through the choice of a smooth function and freely chosen by the designer, a fairly large class of smooth reference signals, and a system class satisfying certain structural properties. The aim is to design, based on the structural assumptions and the input and output information only, a single `simple' control strategy -- called the funnel controller -- so that its application to any system of the given class and to any reference signal results in feasibility of the funnel control objective: that is solutions of the closed-loop system do not exhibit blow-up in finite time, all variables are bounded, and -- most importantly -- the evolution of the error between the system's output and the reference signal remains within the prespecified funnel. In the Introduction, we describe the genesis of funnel control. After that, we investigate diverse system classes amenable to funnel control. Funnel control is shown for systems with arbitrary relative degree and systems described by partial differential equations. Finally, we discuss input constraints and applications.},

  abstract = {The acoustic radiation pressure has found practical application in recent years in instruments measuring sound intensity and in experiments on acoustic levitation. The concept of radiation pressure has, however, long fascinated both optical and acoustical physicists. The history of light radiation pressure goes back more than 200 years to Leonhard Euler, while the concept of acoustic radiation pressure dates from the time and work of Rayleigh. It was pointed out by Brillouin that what we call radiation pressure is not a pressure at all, but a diagonal tensor, all the diagonal terms of which are not identical. The size of the effect is small, and the values obtained for the radiation pressure are very sensitive to boundary conditions and to the approximations that must necessarily be employed. In addition, although the phenomenon is primarily one of nonlinear acoustics, it can be observed down to the lowest sound intensities under certain conditions. Thus, the Rayleigh radiation pressure vanishes for the linear case, but the usually measured Langevin pressure does not. It might be said that radiation pressure is a phenomenon that the observer thinks he understands—for short intervals, and only every now and then.},

Subscribe to Big Think on YouTube ► ~~~/~@bigthink~~ Up next, Einstein’s beef with quantum physics, explained  ► ~~~•~Einstein’s~beef~with~quantum~physics,...~~ Dr. Michio Kaku, the renowned theoretical physicist, walks through the evolutionary journey of quantum computing, from analog to digital to the quantum era. Quantum computers hold immense promise because of their ability to tap into parallel universes, which boosts their computational power exponentially. They could revolutionize agriculture, energy, and medicine, solving complex problems like creating efficient fertilizers, achieving fusion energy, and modeling diseases at the molecular level. The race between major tech companies and intelligence agencies to actualize this power is intense, as they could redefine industries and even global power structures if they succeed. The endeavor isn’t without challenges; we’ve yet to create a fully functional quantum computer. But Kaku envisions a future where quantum computers unravel complex equations, potentially shedding light on profound cosmic mysteries.

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {The current research tests the hypothesis that women have an evolved mate value calibration adaptation that functions to raise or lower their standards in a long-term mate according to their own mate value. A woman’s physical attractiveness is a cardinal component of women’s mate value. We correlated observer-assessed physical attractiveness (face, body, and overall) with expressed preferences for four clusters of mate characteristics (N = 214): (1) hypothesized good-gene indicators (e.g., masculinity, sexiness); (2) hypothesized good investment indicators (e.g., potential income); (3) good parenting indicators (e.g., desire for home and children), and (4) good partner indicators (e.g., being a loving partner). Results supported the hypothesis that high mate value women, as indexed by observer-judged physical attractiveness, expressed elevated standards for all four clusters of mate characteristics. Discussion focuses on potential design features of the hypothesized mate-value calibration adaptation, and suggests an important modification of the trade-off model of women’s mating. A minority of women—notably those low in mate value who are able to escape male mate guarding and the manifold costs of an exposed infidelity—will pursue a mixed mating strategy, obtaining investment from one man and good genes from an extra-pair copulation partner (as the trade-off model predicts). Since the vast majority of women secure genes and direct benefits from the same man, however, most women will attempt to secure the best combination of all desired qualities from the same man.},

This domain representation, which targets VRP applications, allows for an efficient insertion-based search on a partial tour and the implementation of simple, yet efficient filtering algorithms for constraints that enforce time-windows on the visits and capacities on the vehicles. Experiment results demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility of this CP domain for solving some hard VRP problems, including the Dial-A-Ride, the Patient Transportation, and the asymmetric TSP with time windows.},

These forces are induced by a sound wave field on dispersed particles (gas bubbles, liquid drops, particles of dust, etc.) suspended in a fluid and make them drift, cluster in certain space areas, interact with each other, etc. The early theory of this phenomenon is based on a large number of simplifying assumptions, which restrict its capabilities and do not allow one to explain many experimental observations. Recent extensive studies have fundamentally generalized the original theory of acoustic radiation forces and made it possible to understand experimental findings that appeared abnormal within the framework of the early theory, as well as to predict new interesting effects.},

In deriving the general expression for the radiation pressure, it is supposed that the radius of the sphere is arbitrary. Two limiting cases of interest are then considered. In the first of these, it is assumed that the sound wavelength is much larger than the radius of the sphere which is, in turn, much larger than the viscous wavelength, it being supposed that this condition is satisfied both outside and inside the sphere. In the second case, the situation is investigated when the radius of the sphere is small compared with the viscous wavelength which is, in turn, much smaller than the sound wavelength, it being supposed that this condition is satisfied, as before, both outside and inside the sphere. It is shown that in both cases the expressions for the radiation pressure are drastically different from the well-known expressions for the radiation pressure in a perfect fluid: the calculation of the radiation pressure from the formulae obtained for a perfect fluid in the cases when the effect of viscosity is not negligible gives both quantitatively and qualitatively wrong results.},

If the primal is a minimization problem then the dual is a maximization problem (and vice versa). Any feasible solution to the primal (minimization) problem is at least as large as any feasible solution to the dual (maximization) problem. Therefore, the solution to the primal is an upper bound to the solution of the dual, and the solution of the dual is a lower bound to the solution of the primal. This fact is called weak duality. In general, the optimal values of the primal and dual problems need not be equal. Their difference is called the duality gap. For convex optimization problems, the duality gap is zero under a constraint qualification condition. This fact is called strong duality.},

  abstract = {Semidefinite programming (SDP) with diagonal constraints arise in many optimization problems, such as Max-Cut, community detection and group synchronization. Although SDPs can be solved to arbitrary precision in polynomial time, generic convex solvers do not scale well with the dimension of the problem. In order to address this issue, Burer and Monteiro [BM03] proposed to reduce the dimension of the problem by appealing to a low-rank factorization and solve the subsequent non-convex problem instead. In this paper, we present coordinate ascent based methods to solve this non-convex problem with provable convergence guarantees. More specifically, we prove that the block-coordinate maximization algorithm applied to the non-convex Burer-Monteiro method globally converges to a first-order stationary point with a sublinear rate without any assumptions on the problem. We further show that this algorithm converges linearly around a local maximum provided that the objective function exhibits quadratic decay. We establish that this condition generically holds when the rank of the factorization is sufficiently large. Furthermore, incorporating Lanczos method to the block-coordinate maximization, we propose an algorithm that is guaranteed to return a solution that provides 1 − O(1/r) approximation to the original SDP without any assumptions, where r is the rank of the factorization. This approximation ratio is known to be optimal (up to constants) under the unique games conjecture, and we can explicitly quantify the number of iterations to obtain such a solution.},

Feedback linearization techniques may be applied to nonlinear control systems of the form where                         x         (         t         )         ∈                                 R                                   n                                     \{\textbackslash displaystyle x(t)\textbackslash in \textbackslash mathbb \{R\} \textasciicircum\{n\}\}    is the state,                                    u                        1                             (         t         )         ,         …         ,                    u                        m                             (         t         )         ∈                    R                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle u\_\{1\}(t),\textbackslash ldots ,u\_\{m\}(t)\textbackslash in \textbackslash mathbb \{R\} \}    are the inputs. The approach involves transforming a nonlinear control system into an equivalent linear control system through a change of variables and a suitable control input. In particular, one seeks a change of coordinates                         z         =         Φ         (         x         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle z=\textbackslash Phi (x)\}    and control input                         u         =         a         (         x         )         +         b         (         x         )                  v         ,                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle u=a(x)+b(x)\textbackslash,v,\}    so that the dynamics of                         x         (         t         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle x(t)\}    in the coordinates                         z         (         t         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle z(t)\}     take the form of a linear, controllable control system, An outer-loop control strategy for the resulting linear control system can then be applied to achieve the control objective.},

  abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are threatened by cyber attacks just as any computing system. Even worse, due to them being embedded into the physical world, consequences can be catastrophic. The widespread use of unsafe languages and limited operating system protections makes code-reuse attacks particularly dangerous to smaller CPS. Existing effective countermeasures are either not applicable because resources are limited, or they introduce an unacceptable overhead. In this work, we propose a fine-grained load-time software diversity approach that is enabled by compile-time preparations. Its linear-time loading algorithm makes it feasible for resource-constrained CPS. We demonstrate our approach by fully diversifying an application including the real-time operating system FreeRTOS on an ARM real-time microcontroller. Our performance evaluation using the TACLe benchmark suite shows that the worst-case execution time overhead is acceptable.},

Such “exemplars” can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called “affinity propagation,” which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

  abstract = {We describe and experimentally explore a nonlinear stiffness model of the trapping of a solid particle in a single-axis acoustic levitator. In contrast to the commonly employed linear stiffness assumption, our nonlinear model accurately predicts the response of the system. Our nonlinear model approximates the acoustic field in the vicinity of the trap as a one-dimensional sinusoid and solves the resulting dynamics using numerical continuation. In particular, we predict a softening of stiffness with amplitude as well as period-doubling bifurcations, even for small excitation amplitudes of ≈2\% of the wavelength. These nonlinear dynamic features are observed experimentally in a single-axis levitator operating at 40\,kHz and trapping millimetre-scale expanded polystyrene spheres. Excellent agreement between the observed and predicted behaviour is obtained suggesting that this relatively simple model captures the relevant physical phenomena. This new model enables the dynamic instabilities of trapped particles to be accurately predicted, thereby benefiting contactless transportation and manipulation applications.},

The concept is based on the high-gain controllability of minimum-phase systems with relative degree one and known high-frequency gain. The approach allows prescribed transient behavior without identification and/or parameter estimation, although the plant is only structurally known. As most industrial applications - also the considered robotic systems - exhibit higher relative degrees, funnel-control is not directly applicable. Therefore a state-feedback like extension is introduced, which permits the reduction of the relative degree and retains the minimum-phase property. The additional implementation of a Pi-like structure assures good disturbance rejection and asymptotic tracking of the reference position trajectory. Simulation results for a 6-DOF Manutec R3 robot show the achievable performance of one overall MIMO Funnel Controller for all joints and one SISO funnel controller for each joint (6 controllers).},

  abstract = {This overview presents a simple high-gain adaptive controller — the funnel controller — and its possible applications in mechatronics. The funnel controller neither identifies nor estimates the system under control and is applicable for (nonlinear) systems being minimum-phase (or having stable zero-dynamics in the nonlinear case), having relative degree one or two and known sign of the high-frequency gain. So only “structural system properties” must be satisfied to allow for controller implementation. Moreover, control performance is robust to parameter uncertainties or variations not affecting the system structure. The proportional funnel controller assures tracking of time-varying reference signals with prescribed transient accuracy, i.e. the tracking error evolves within a “funnel” with prescribed boundary (i.e. a continuous function of time chosen by the control designer). To illustrate applicability of funnel control in “real world” measurement results are presented for speed and position control of an unknown rotatory system subject to (varying) friction and load disturbances. The results are compared with classical PI/PID control.},

  abstract = {Most spatial audio reproduction systems have the constraint that all loudspeakers must be equidistant from the listener, a property which is difficult to achieve in real rooms. In traditional Ambisonics this arises because the spherical harmonic functions, which are used to encode the spatial sound-field, are orthonormal over a sphere and because loudspeaker proximity is not fully addressed. Recently, significant progress to lift this restriction has been made through the theory of sound field synthesis, which formalizes various spatial audio systems in a mathematical framework based on the single layer potential. This approach has shown many benefits but the theory, which treats audio rendering as a sound-soft scattering problem, can appear one step removed from the physical reality and also possesses frequencies where the solution is non-unique. In the time-domain Boundary Element Method approaches to address such non-uniqueness amount to statements which test the flow of acoustic energy rather than considering pressure alone. This paper applies that notion to spatial audio rendering by re-examining the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral equation as a wave-matching metric, and suggests a physical interpretation of its kernel in terms of common acoustic power flux density between waves. It is shown that the spherical basis functions (spherical harmonics multiplied by spherical Bessel or Hankel functions) are orthogonal over any arbitrary surface with respect to this metric. Finally other applications are discussed, including design of high-order microphone arrays and the coupling of virtual acoustic models to auralization hardware.},

After a decomposition of the state space and some change of variables related to the Byrnes–Isidori form, it is shown that the funnel controller presented in Berger et al. (2020) achieves the control objective under some assumptions on the nonlinear system dynamics, like well-posedness and Bounded-Input-State Bounded-Output (BISBO) stability. The theory is applied to the regulation of the temperature in a chemical plug-flow tubular reactor whose reaction kinetics are modeled by the Arrhenius nonlinearity. Furthermore a damped sine–Gordon model is shown to fit the required assumptions as well. The theoretical results are illustrated by means of numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {Poverty is a common experience for many children and families in the United States. Children \&lt;18 years old are disproportionately affected by poverty, making up 33\% of all people in poverty. Living in a poor or low-income household has been linked to poor health and increased risk for mental health problems in both children and adults that can persist across the life span. Despite their high need for mental health services, children and families living in poverty are least likely to be connected with high-quality mental health care. Pediatric primary care providers are in a unique position to take a leading role in addressing disparities in access to mental health care, because many low-income families come to them first to address mental health concerns. In this report, we discuss the impact of poverty on mental health, barriers to care, and integrated behavioral health care models that show promise in improving access and outcomes for children and families residing in the contexts of poverty. We also offer practice recommendations, relevant to providers in the primary care setting, that can help improve access to mental health care in this population.},

The algorithm uses the branch and bound paradigm that applies the alternating direction method of multipliers as the bounding routine to solve the basic semidefinite relaxation strengthened by a subset of hypermetric inequalities. The benefit of the new approach is a less computationally expensive update rule for the dual variable with respect to the inequality constraints. We provide a theoretical convergence of the algorithm as well as extensive computational experiments with this method, to show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, by combining algorithmic ingredients from the serial algorithm, we develop an efficient distributed parallel solver based on MPI.},

  abstract = {A randomized Kaczmarz method was recently proposed for phase retrieval, which has been shown numerically to exhibit empirical performance over other state-of-the-art phase retrieval algorithms both in terms of the sampling complexity and in terms of computation time. While the rate of convergence has been studied well in the real case where the signals and measurement vectors are all real-valued, there is no guarantee for the convergence in the complex case. In fact, the linear convergence of the randomized Kaczmarz method for phase retrieval in the complex setting is left as a conjecture by Tan and Vershynin. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical guarantees for it. We show that for random measurements \$\textbackslash mathbf\{a\}\_j \textbackslash in \textbackslash mathbb\{C\}\textasciicircum n, j=1,\textbackslash ldots,m \$ which are drawn independently and uniformly from the complex unit sphere, or equivalent are independent complex Gaussian random vectors, when \$m \textbackslash ge Cn\$ for some universal positive constant \$C\$, the randomized Kaczmarz scheme with a good initialization converges linearly to the target solution (up to a global phase) in expectation with high probability. This gives a positive answer to that conjecture.},

The class encompasses a wide variety of nonlinear and infinite-dimensional systems and contains – as a prototype subclass – all finite-dimensional linear single-input single-output minimum-phase systems with positive high-frequency gain. The control objective is to ensure that, for an arbitrary ÊM -valued reference signal r of class W 1,∞ (absolutely continuous and bounded with essentially bounded derivative) and every system of class S, the tracking error e between plant output and reference signal evolves within a prespecified performance envelope or funnel in the sense that ϕ(t) e(t) {$<$} 1 for all t ≥ 0, where ϕ a prescribed real-valued function of class W 1,∞ with the property that ϕ(s) {$>$} 0 for all s {$>$} 0 and lim infs→∞ ϕ(s) {$>$} 0. A simple (neither adaptive nor dynamic) error feedback control of the form u(t) = −α(ϕ(t) e(t) )e(t) is introduced which achieves the objective whilst maintaining boundedness of the control and of the scalar gain α(ϕ(·) e(·) ).},

  abstract = {The development of contactless acoustic-levitation technology has grown rapidly in recent years, and the acoustic-levitation system is an electromechanical system with complex dynamics. However, the traditional differential equation model, used as the core basement for the system, is ineffective at describing the effects of structural changes or parameter adjustments on system performance, which is vital for the design and analysis of the system. This paper proposes a transfer function model to solve this issue. The model can characterize the dynamic performance of the system. Meanwhile, it is competent to describe the effects of structural changes or parameter adjustments on system performance because it can directly derive the relationship between the system performance index and the system parameter variation. It simplifies system design and analysis. In the proposed model, the displacement of the acoustic trap and that of the object are considered as the input and output, respectively, clearly demonstrating the relationship between the acoustic-trap movement and the object motion. Based on the model, the time-domain dynamic performance and the frequency-domain characteristics of the system are systematically described. Furthermore, the model describes the effects of the parameters (the stiffness coefficient, levitated objects, and media) adjustments on the time-domain dynamic performance (damped oscillation frequency, rise time, and peak time) and the frequency-domain characteristics (resonance frequency and bandwidth frequency) of the system. The damping oscillation frequency, resonance frequency, and band­ width frequency are positively correlated with the stiffness coefficient, while the rise time and peak time are negatively correlated with the stiffness coefficient. These results are verified by numerical simulations and physical experiments. These works will support the design of the acoustic-levitation controller, serve the analysis of the whole system performance, and guide the parameter adjustment during the debugging process. The findings of this paper will lay the foundation for precision motion control of levitated objects, promoting the development of acoustic-levitation technology.},

  abstract = {The boundary element method (BEM) in the context of acoustics or Helmholtz problems is reviewed in this paper. The basis of the BEM is initially developed for Laplace’s equation. The boundary integral equation formulations for the standard interior and exterior acoustic problems are stated and the boundary element methods are derived through collocation. It is shown how interior modal analysis can be carried out via the boundary element method. Further extensions in the BEM in acoustics are also reviewed, including half-space problems and modelling the acoustic field surrounding thin screens. Current research in linking the boundary element method to other methods in order to solve coupled vibro-acoustic and aero-acoustic problems and methods for solving inverse problems via the BEM are surveyed. Applications of the BEM in each area of acoustics are referenced. The computational complexity of the problem is considered and methods for improving its general efficiency are reviewed. The significant maintenance issues of the standard exterior acoustic solution are considered, in particular the weighting parameter in combined formulations such as Burton and Miller’s equation. The commonality of the integral operators across formulations and hence the potential for development of a software library approach is emphasised.},

  abstract = {Much effort has been put into improving the predictability of real-time systems, especially in safety-critical environments, which provides designers with a rich set of methods and tools to attest safety in situations with no or a limited number of accidental faults. However, with increasing connectivity of real-time systems and a wide availability of increasingly sophisticated exploits, security and, in particular, the consequences of predictability on security become concerns of equal importance. Time-triggered scheduling with offline constructed tables provides determinism and simplifies timing inference, however, at the same time, time-triggered scheduling creates vulnerabilities by allowing attackers to target their attacks to specific, deterministically scheduled and possibly safety-critical tasks. In this paper, we analyze the severity of these vulnerabilities by assuming successful compromise of a subset of the tasks running in a real-time system and by investigating the attack potential that attackers gain from them. Moreover, we discuss two ways to mitigate direct attacks: slot-level online randomization of schedules, and offline schedulediversification. We evaluate these mitigation strategies with a real-world case study to show their practicability for mitigating not only accidentally malicious behavior, but also malicious behavior triggered by attackers on purpose.},

In this paper, force conditions on micrometer size polystyrene microspheres in acoustic standing wave fields were investigated. The COMSOL® Mutiphysics particle tracing module was used to numerically simulate force conditions on various particles as a function of time. The velocity of particle movement was experimentally measured using particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). Through experimental and numerical simulation, the functions of ARF and AS in trapping and patterning were analyzed. It is shown that ARF is dominant in trapping and patterning large particles while the impact of AS increases rapidly with decreasing particle size. The combination of using both ARF and AS for medium size particles can obtain different patterns with only using ARF. Findings of the present study will aid the design of acoustic-driven microfluidic devices to increase the diversity of particle patterning.},

It has been shownby Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associatedquantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the averagequantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quantization schemesfor 26 quanta, b = 1,2, t ,7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

This allows us to manipulate cells, liquids, compounds or living things without touching or contaminating them. However, acoustic levitation has required the targets to be enclosed with acoustic elements or had limited manoeuvrability. Here we optimize the phases used to drive an ultrasonic phased array and show that acoustic levitation can be employed to translate, rotate and manipulate particles using even a single-sided emitter. Furthermore, we introduce the holographic acoustic elements framework that permits the rapid generation of traps and provides a bridge between optical and acoustical trapping. Acoustic structures shaped as tweezers, twisters or bottles emerge as the optimum mechanisms for tractor beams or containerless transportation. Single-beam levitation could manipulate particles inside our body for applications in targeted drug delivery or acoustically controlled micro-machines that do not interfere with magnetic resonance imaging.},

Unfortunately, typical implementations of busy-waiting tend to produce large amounts of memory and interconnect contention, introducing performance bottlenecks that become markedly more pronounced as applications scale. We argue that this problem is not fundamental, and that one can in fact construct busy-wait synchronization algorithms that induce no memory or interconnect contention. The key to these algorithms is for every processor to spin on separate locally-accessible ag variables, and for some other processor to terminate the spin with a single remote write operation at an appropriate time. Flag variables may be locally-accessible as a result of coherent caching, or by virtue of allocation in the local portion of physically distributed shared memory.},

It has seen more than 700 research articles published in this time and has seen a recent resurgence in the past 5 years, thanks to low cost developments. As well as investigating the basic physics of levitated drops, acoustic levitation has been touted for container free delivery of samples to a variety of measurements systems, most notably in various spectroscopy techniques including Raman and Fourier transform infrared in addition to numerous X-ray techniques. For 30 years, the workhorse of the acoustic levitation apparatus was a stack comprising a piezoelectric transducer coupled to a horn shaped radiative element often referred to as the Langevin horn. Decades of effort have been dedicated to such devices, paired with a matching and opposing device or a reflector, but they have a significant dependence on temperature and require precision alignment. The last decade has seen a significant shift away from these in favor of arrays of digitally driven, inexpensive transducers, giving a new dynamic to the topic which we review herein.},

  abstract = {Schedule randomization is one of the recently introduced security defenses against schedule-based attacks, i.e., attacks whose success depends on a particular ordering between the execution window of an attacker and a victim task within the system. It falls into the category of information hiding (as opposed to deterministic isolation-based defenses) and is designed to reduce the attacker’s ability to infer the future schedule. This paper aims to investigate the limitations and vulnerabilities of schedule randomization-based defenses in real-time systems. We first provide definitions, categorization, and examples of schedulebased attacks, and then discuss the challenges of employing schedule randomization in real-time systems. Further, we provide a preliminary security test to determine whether a certain timing relation between the attacker and victim tasks will never happen in systems scheduled by a fixed-priority scheduling algorithm. Finally, we compare fixed-priority scheduling against schedule-randomization techniques in terms of the success rate of various schedule-based attacks for both synthetic and realworld applications. Our results show that, in many cases, schedule randomization either has no security benefits or can even increase the success rate of the attacker depending on the priority relation between the attacker and victim tasks.},

  author = {Nemitz, Catherine E and Amert, Tanya and Anderson, James H},
  date = {2018},
  abstract = {During the past decade, parallelism-related issues have been at the forefront of real-time systems research due to the advent of multicore technologies. In the coming years, such issues will loom ever larger due to increasing core counts. Having more cores means a greater potential exists for platform capacity loss when the available parallelism cannot be fully exploited. In this paper, such capacity loss is considered in the context of real-time locking protocols. In this context, lock nesting becomes a key concern as it can result in transitive blocking chains that force tasks to execute sequentially unnecessarily. Such chains can be quite long on a larger machine. Contention-sensitive real-time locking protocols have been proposed as a means of “breaking” transitive blocking chains, but such protocols tend to have high overhead due to more complicated lock/unlock logic. To ease such overhead, the usage of lock servers is considered herein. In particular, four specific lock-server paradigms are proposed and many nuances concerning their deployment are explored. Experiments are presented that show that, by executing cache hot, lock servers can enable reductions in lock/unlock overhead of up to 86\%. Such reductions make contention-sensitive protocols a viable approach in practice.},

  abstract = {Given the importance of continuous traffic flow forecasting in most of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications, where every new traffic data become available in every few minutes or seconds, the main objective of this study is to perform a multi-step ahead traffic flow forecasting that can meet a trade-off between accuracy, low computational load, and limited memory capacity. To this aim, based on adaptive Kalman filtering theory, two forecasting approaches are proposed. We suggest solving a multi-step ahead prediction problem as a filtering one by considering pseudo-observations coming from the averaged historical flow or the output of other predictors in the literature. For taking into account the stochastic modeling of the process and the current measurements we resort to an adaptive scheme. The proposed forecasting methods are evaluated by using measurements of the Grenoble south ring.},

  abstract = {Within the scope of a study of external noise propagation from moving ground vehicles, a numerical method is developed to compute the acoustic field emitted by a moving source in the presence of scattering objects such as roads, buildings or noise-shields. This method is developed with the purpose of being used in a vehicle design process and therefore it must have a low computational cost, which requires a certain number of approximations. The case of a fixed point source is studied first then the effect of a movement of the source is taken into account through the introduction of a retarded time. The acoustic source is assumed to be represented by one or many harmonic monopoles of possibly different frequency moving with a constant speed in a quiescent flow field. Scattering from nearby perfectly reflecting objects is computed through a Kirchhoff–Helmholtz integral equation applying the Kirchhoff approximation. A ray-surface intersection algorithm to compute shadow areas is proposed. The method is validated against analytical solutions and experimental results for a fixed source, and against a higher-order finite difference time-domain method for the multiple scattering of a moving source. Results are good and show that this method can potentially be used to predict urban noise.},

A return-oriented program chains together short instruction sequences already present in a program’s address space, each of which ends in a “return” instruction.                          Return-oriented programming defeats the W⊕X protections recently deployed by Microsoft, Intel, and AMD; in this context, it can be seen as a generalization of traditional return-into-libc attacks. But the threat is more general. Return-oriented programming is readily exploitable on multiple architectures and systems. It also bypasses an entire category of security measures---those that seek to prevent malicious computation by preventing the execution of malicious code.             To demonstrate the wide applicability of return-oriented programming, we construct a Turing-complete set of building blocks called gadgets using the standard C libraries of two very different architectures: Linux/x86 and Solaris/SPARC. To demonstrate the power of return-oriented programming, we present a high-level, general-purpose language for describing return-oriented exploits and a compiler that translates it to gadgets.},

This is performed in two ways, first by applying the Separation of Variables method, and, second, by using the Method of Lines as a special Finite-Difference technique. With this Green’s function we are able to resolve some contradictions concerning conceptual aspects of the Separation of Variables method, the Finite-Difference methods, and the Boundary Integral Equation methods which have been developed for rigorously solving non-separable boundary value problems. The necessary mathematical background, the relation to Waterman’s T matrix, and simplifications due to certain symmetry properties of the boundary surface will be discussed. In this paper we focus on the scalar problem. The extension to the vector case for electromagnetic wave scattering is in preparation and will be published later.},

  abstract = {A numerical scheme has been developed to calculate the acoustic radiation force and streaming for spherical objects in a standing wave. A combination of multipole series expansion and Stokeslet method is implemented for the calculations. The scheme was verified by comparing its results with those obtained from the analytical solution, proposed by Doinikov (1994). Unlike the analytical solutions, the proposed numerical scheme is applicable to the case of multiple spheres in a viscous fluid.},

  abstract = {Studies on radiation pressure in acoustics and optics have enriched one another and have a long common history. Acoustic radiation pressure is used for metrology, levitation, particle trapping and actuation. However, the dexterity and selectivity of single-beam optical tweezers are still to be matched with acoustical devices. Optical tweezers can trap, move and positioned micron size particles, biological samples or even atoms with subnanometer accuracy in three dimensions. One limitation of optical tweezers is the weak force that can be applied without thermal damage due to optical absorption. Acoustical tweezers overcome this limitation since the radiation pressure scales as the field intensity divided by the speed of propagation of the wave. However, the feasibility of single beam acoustical tweezers was demonstrated only recently. In this paper, we propose a historical review of the strong similarities but also the specificities of acoustical and optical radiation pressures, from the expression of the force to the development of single-beam acoustical tweezers.},

A control structure is developed which ensures that, for every member of the underlying system class and every admissible reference signal, the tracking error evolves in a prescribed funnel chosen to reflect transient and asymptotic accuracy objectives. Two fundamental properties underpin the system class: bounded-input bounded-output stable internal dynamics, and a high-gain property (an antecedent of which is the concept of sign-definite high-frequency gain in the context of linear systems).},

  abstract = {Als Totzeit (auch Laufzeit oder Transportzeit genannt) wird in der Regelungstechnik die Zeitspanne zwischen der Signaländerung am Systemeingang und der Signalantwort am Systemausgang einer Regelstrecke bezeichnet. Jede Änderung des Eingangssignals ruft eine um die Totzeit verzögerte Änderung des Ausgangssignals hervor. Ein System mit Totzeit ohne zusätzliches Zeitverhalten wird auch als Totzeitglied bezeichnet. Totzeitglieder lassen sich nicht mit gewöhnlichen Differentialgleichungen, sondern nur über das Frequenzverhalten als transzendente Funktionen (nicht algebraisch) beschreiben. Damit erschweren sie die Parametrierung eines Reglers im Regelkreis, weil sich transzendente Funktionen nicht mit gebrochen rationalen Funktionen eines Übertragungssystems zur algebraischen Berechnung kombinieren lassen. Es kann deshalb sinnvoll sein, je nach verwendeter Programmiersprache Totzeitmodelle zu bestimmen, die näherungsweise als gebrochen rationale Funktionen geschrieben werden können. Die Untersuchung des Frequenzverhaltens von unterschiedlichen linearen Übertragungssystemen mit einem Totzeitglied bei Anwendung des Bode-Diagramms oder der Ortskurve des Frequenzgangs am aufgeschnittenen Regelkreis dient der Erkennung der Stabilität des geschlossenen Regelkreises, der Systemanalyse von linearen dynamischen Übertragungsgliedern G(s) und Totzeitverhalten.Die Darstellung des Übertragungsverhaltens im Zeitbereich von Totzeitgliedern in Verbindung mit linearen und nichtlinearen Übertragungsgliedern im Regelkreis kann zu einem vernünftigen Berechnungsaufwand nur mit der numerischen Mathematik erreicht werden. Dabei werden in Abhängigkeit von einem gegebenen Eingangssignal Wertefolgen im zeitdiskreten Abstand Δt\{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash Delta t\} berechnet. In einer Grafik lässt sich so ein geschlossenes Zeitverhalten für die Ausgangsgröße y(t)\{\textbackslash displaystyle y(t)\} und interessierende Zwischengrößen darstellen.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we give a closer look into the high-frequency approximations of two integrals associated with the name of Kirchhoff. The first one is known in the geophysical literature as the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral. It computes, in the time or frequency domains, the seismic acoustic/elastic response at a receiver, given the locations of a source-receiver pair, a laterally inhomogeneous velocity model and a reflector. It is traditionally employed, in its plane-wave or physical optics approximation, in forward propagation and modelling problems. The second one, is the more recent diffraction-stack integral also known as the Kirchhoff-migration integral. With it, the observed seismic response of an unknown reflector, here formulated for arbitrary source-receiver configuration) is transformed (imaged) into the reflector. The imaging that aims at extracting angle-dependent reflection coefficients, is performed with the help of a laterally inhomogeneous macro-velocity model. Both integrals can be understood, both qualitatively and quantitatively, as asymptotically inverse operations to each other. This fact physically explains why a diffractionstack migration works as it does.},

In this article, however, charisma is generalized to take in all human beings and is conceptualized as a multi-dimensional cognitive-affective phenomenon. The article presents a pilot study aimed at providing an adequate operational definition of the construct as well as an initial tool for its measurement. A following literature review shows how authors have developed the concept of charisma and its initial operational dimensions for empirical research. A questionnaire is developed in three stages. The factor analyses applied in stages two and three point towards a six-factor solution (i.e. six dimensions of charisma). Further analysis reveals that the developed instrument is reliable and viable as well as applicable for future theoretical and practical work.},

In this approach, the robot performs a single boustrophedon motion to cover an unvisited region until it reaches a critical point. To continue covering the next unvisited region, the robot wisely detects backtracking points based on its accumulated knowledge, determines the best backtracking point as the starting point of the next boustrophedon motion, and applies an intelligent backtracking mechanism based on the proposed A* search with smoothed path on tiling so as to reach the starting point with the shortest collision-free path. The robot achieves complete coverage when no backtracking point is detected. Computer simulations and experiments in real workspaces prove that our proposed BA* is efficient for the complete coverage task of cleaning robots.},

Ax \textbackslash le b runs in polynomial time if its running time can be bounded by a polynomial D\textasciicircum r, where "r" is some integer, and D is the bit-size of the data of the problem, or in other words, D is the amount of memory that it takes to store the matrix A and the vectors b and c. On the other hand, an algorithm runs in strongly polynomial time if its running time can be bounded by a polynomial n\textasciicircum r m\textasciicircum s, where "r" and "s" are integers, "n" is the number of variables and "m" is the number of constraints.  The distinction is subtle, but is an important one. Essentially, a polynomial time algorithm is allowed to take more time as the size of the coefficients of A grows (while keeping the dimensions of A constant), but a strongly polynomial time algorithm is not. (I glossed over some details here. For example in the definition of strong polynomial time algorithms, we assume that the basic arithmetic operations take a constant time no matter the size of the operands.) The interior point method is a polynomial time algorithm, but not a strongly polynomial time one (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01544). ---------------------- Typos: - "Schedueling" should be "Scheduling" -------------- Timestamps: - 0:00 Motivating Example - 0:39 Definition - 1:07 Applications - 1:42 Code - 2:00 Open Problems --------------- Credit: 🐍 Manim and Python : https://github.com/3b1b/manim 🐵 Blender3D: https://www.blender.org/ 🗒️ Emacs: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ Music/Sound: www.bensound.com, Zapsplat.com This video would not have been possible without the help of Gökçe Dayanıklı.}

We cast the phase retrieval problem as a non-convex quadratic program over a complex phase vector and formulate a tractable relaxation (called PhaseCut) similar to the classical MaxCut semidefinite program. We solve this problem using a provably convergent block coordinate descent algorithm whose structure is similar to that of the original greedy algorithm in Gerchberg and Saxton [1972], where each iteration is a matrix vector product. Numerical results show the performance of this approach over three different phase retrieval problems, in comparison with greedy phase retrieval algorithms and matrix completion formulations.},

This locking protocol relies on a novel technique for ordering the satisfaction of resource requests to ensure a bounded duration of priority inversions for nested requests. This technique can be applied on partitioned, clustered, and globally scheduled systems in which waiting is realized by either spinning or suspending. Furthermore, this technique can be used to construct fine-grained nested locking protocols that are efficient under spin-based, suspension-oblivious or suspension-aware analysis of priority inversions. Locking protocols built upon this technique perform no worse than coarse-grained locking mechanisms, while allowing for increased parallelism in the average case (and, depending upon the task set, better worst-case performance).},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel algorithm, named Reshuffling, for manipulating a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE). An algorithm is introduced to rearrange edges in the graph representation of the DAE in order to resolve cycles. The algorithm comprises a method to detect cycles of linear equations in the bipartite graph and to rearrange the cycle nodes by substituting equations. The incidence structure of the cycle changes, which can lead to a dissection of cycles. As an effect, constant variables can be evaluated or implicit constraints can be revealed and thus singularities prevented. For some models, this is essential to solve the system. Furthermore, the performance can be increased because the number of necessary equations needed to calculate the state derivatives is reduced or large systems of equations are split into various smaller ones. This also helps parallelization as it alleviates bottlenecks. The depicted algorithm was developed using the DAE derived from Modelica models and the algorithm is implemented in the OpenModelica Compiler (OMC).},

  abstract = {Creating impact in real-world settings requires artificial intelligence techniques to span the full pipeline from data, to predictive models, to decisions. These components are typically approached separately: a machine learning model is first trained via a measure of predictive accuracy, and then its predictions are used as input into an optimization algorithm which produces a decision. However, the loss function used to train the model may easily be misaligned with the end goal, which is to make the best decisions possible. Hand-tuning the loss function to align with optimization is a difficult and error-prone process (which is often skipped entirely). We focus on combinatorial optimization problems and introduce a general framework for decision-focused learning, where the machine learning model is directly trained in conjunction with the optimization algorithm to produce high-quality decisions. Technically, our contribution is a means of integrating common classes of discrete optimization problems into deep learning or other predictive models, which are typically trained via gradient descent. The main idea is to use a continuous relaxation of the discrete problem to propagate gradients through the optimization procedure. We instantiate this framework for two broad classes of combinatorial problems: linear programs and submodular maximization. Experimental results across a variety of domains show that decision-focused learning often leads to improved optimization performance compared to traditional methods. We find that standard measures of accuracy are not a reliable proxy for a predictive model's utility in optimization, and our method's ability to specify the true goal as the model's training objective yields substantial dividends across a range of decision problems.},

  abstract = {Most acoustic levitation techniques are limited to objects smaller than half the wavelength. To overcome this limit, different strategies have been proposed for suspending macroscopic objects in mid-air. Two approaches to levitate spherical and non-spherical macroscopic objects have been recently presented: the acoustical virtual vortices and the boundary hologram method. However, the former approach places high demands on the available hardware due to the mandatory high switching rate while the latter uses a computationally expensive model that prevents future real-time manipulation. In the present work, we demonstrate the single-beam levitation of a Mie sphere using a 2D transducer array. To achieve this, we employ a computationally fast sound field model based on spherical harmonics expansion. To obtain a suitable array output, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the stability of the sphere while keeping the net force balanced. In addition, we prove the local asymptotic stability for the equilibrium position and determine a domain of attraction using Lyapunov-based methods. In experiments, we show that the macroscopic sphere is stably levitated in a twin tuning forks trap, which results from a superposition of two twin trap signatures and a bottle trap signature. This result could open up the possibility of a computationally fast and convenient non-contact manipulation of macroscopic objects by a superposition of holographic elements in future applications.},

Although this algorithm has been studied for the real-valued case in [ 28], its generalization to the complex-valued case is nontrivial and has been left as a conjecture. This paper applies a different approach by establishing the connection between the convergence of the algorithm and the convexity of an objective function. Based on the connection, it demonstrates that when the sensing vectors are sampled uniformly from a unit sphere in \$\{\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\}\textasciicircum n\$ and the number of sensing vectors \$m\$ satisfies \$m\&gt;O(n\textbackslash log n)\$ as \$n, m\textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty \$, then this algorithm with a good initialization achieves linear convergence to the solution with high probability. The method can be applied to other statistical models of sensing vectors as well. A similar convergence result is established for the unitary model, where the sensing vectors are from the columns of random orthogonal matrices.             2000 Math Subject Classification: 68W20, 68W27, 92D25.},

  abstract = {Speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities such as Spectre reveal that conventional architecture designs lack security consideration. This article proposes a software transparent defense framework, named as Conditional Speculation, against Spectre vulnerabilities found on traditional out-of-order microprocessors. It introduces the concept of security dependence to mark speculative memory instructions which could leak information with potential security risks. More specifically, security-dependent instructions are detected and marked with suspect speculation flags in the Issue Queue. All the instructions can be speculatively issued for execution in accordance with the classic out-of-order pipeline. For those instructions with suspect speculation flags, they are considered as safe instructions if their speculative execution dose not refill new cache lines with unauthorized privilege data. Otherwise, they are considered as unsafe instructions and thus not allowed to execute speculatively. To pursue a balance of performance and security, we investigate two filtering mechanisms, Cache-hit-based Hazard Filter and Trusted Page Buffer-based Hazard Filter to filter out false security hazards. As for true security hazards, we have two approaches to prevent them from changing cache states. One is to block all unsafe access, the other is to fetch them from lower-level caches or memory to a speculative buffer temporarily, and refill them after confirming that they are on the correct execution path. Our design philosophy is to speculatively execute safe instructions to maintain the performance benefits of out-of-order execution while delaying the cache updates for speculative execution of unsafe instructions for security consideration. We evaluate Conditional Speculation in terms of performance, security, and area. The experimental results show that the hardware overhead is marginal and the performance overhead is minimal.},
